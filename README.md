This C++ program serves as the final project for ENSF337, applying C++ programming principles and object-oriented concepts to visualize a flight seat map. The application reads passenger details from a text file, displaying them alongside seat numbers. Users can add or remove passengers and save flight data. To use the program, compile the provided source files (Flight.cpp, Node.cpp, flight.cpp, etc.) using a C++ compiler, and execute the resulting executable. Interact with the program to manage passengers and explore seating arrangements. For a quick start, refer to the example text file (flight_info.txt) and follow the instructions in main.cpp.
